# UFOs
# Overview of Project:

For this project we are creating a table using javascript,HTML and CSS of UFO sighting that allow users to search through the table for specific information.  

# Results:

Once entering the website we can see the basic opening and title with the picture at the below:

From this image below we have 5 different filters to choose from the date, city,state,country and shape.You can choose any of these filters to enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

# Summary:
We created a page that looks clean and has more table filters,that allows the user to filter through the different sightings in our data set. 

 My two recommendations for improving this website would 
 - We can add the Download button which allows the user to download the table.  
 - Adding another site that would be constantly updating our data adding new sightings to our page.
